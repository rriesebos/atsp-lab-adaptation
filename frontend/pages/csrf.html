        <h1>Cross-Site Request Forgery</h1>
        <div class="jumbotron">
          <!-- <hr><h3>Authentication</h3> -->
          
          <hr><h3>What</h3>
          <p>
            Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a type of web exploit in which the attacker makes the user submit a (web) request they did not intend.
            More specifically, the end user unknowingly executes unwanted actions on an application in which the user is authenticated. 
            The malicious request does not originate from the vulnerable application itself, but rather
            from a different source. This source does not need to be related to the vulnerable application itself. The attacker can achieve this in 
            various ways such as specially crafted image tags, exploits in URLs and hidden form elements.  
          </p>
          <hr><h3>How</h3>
          <p>
            An absolute user-side requirement for this type of attack, is to be authenticated in the target web application. The other requirement
            is for the user to somehow activate the attack. This can be in the form of visiting a malicious URL, opening an email or clicking an 
            unknown link. The vulnerable web application needs to allow malicious behaviour solely through URLs. Either with query parameters, request bodies or simply a different subdomain.
          </p>
          <p>
            The request needs to be embedded in the attack, because the attack is user-side, this also means that attacker has no access to any results
            of the performed attack. The user fires the request, so the user also receives the response. This means the attacker has no way of knowing
            whether the attack was successful or not, apart from observing any side-effects (such as an increased bank balance).   
          </p>
          <p>
            The main problem of this type of attack is that the browser cannot distinguish between intended or forged requests. This 
            places the burden of verifying the request on the web application, which in this case is left vulnerable to such an attack. 
          </p>      
          <hr><h3>Consequences</h3>
          <p>
            Everything the authenticated user can normally do on the vulnerable application, can now be performed by the attacker as if they were 
            the user. This means the severity of consequences depends on the sensitivity of the application.
          </p>
          <hr><h3>Prevention</h3>
          <p>
            There are three user-side steps one can undertake in order to avoid (some of) these kinds of attacks:
          </p>
          <ul class="references">
            <li>Log off from applications once you are done using them</li>
            <li>Leave CORS disabled in your browser settings</li>
            <li>Do not click or visit things that you do not trust or are unfamiliar with</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <br>
            As the browser will never be able to distinguish between request intentions, the server side is tasked with mitigating the risks of CSRF-attacks.
            The most important one is token-based access. Ideally creating unique tokens for each session which only lasts for the session duration. This means
            that as soon as the user leaves the application the token expires, as well as after a certain amount of time the token will expire. If the user is still
            on the website after the token expires this can simply be refreshed in order to prevent user experience degradation.
          </p>
          <hr><h3>Examples</h3>

          <p>
              Once again, we are customers at <i>insecurebanking.com</i>. This bank of course supports transactions from and to other users. But before being able to create a transaction, the user should be authenticated.
              You can authenticate as one of the users of insecurebanking.com. Their credentials can be found in the table on the right.
              After you have authenticated, a unique token is stored in the browser. This token is stored in a cookie, and is attached to each request made to the domain of <i>insecurebanking.com</i>. 
              The backend of the web application then uses this token to make sure that you are the person using the web application.

            <p>
              In order to make a transaction, a form is provided where the users can fill in the details of the transaction:
            </p>
          <div class="alert alert-info">
            <h4>Creating a transaction</h4>
            <form class="inline-form">
              <div class="form-group">
                <label for="toId">To ID</label>

            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
              After the user has filled in the form, and clicked the "Make transaction" button, the web application will create a request to the backend of the application. 
              After creating the request, you can click the "Refresh" button on the overview to see the newly created transaction added to the list.
              
              The values in the form are used as URL parameters in a GET request. This request to the backend will look like this:
          </p>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
          // An example of the request used to transfer money
          <input class="request-input" type="text" value="http://insecurebanking.com/api/transfer_money?to=<USER_ID>&amount=<AMOUNT>"/>
          </pre> 

          <p>
            <h3>The evil website</h3>
            The user is now authenticated, and able to send requests to transfer money to the backend. As explained before, a CSRF attack tries to trick the user sending a request to the backend with different parameters.
            In the situation of the banking website, the attacker would try to transfer money to its own account. 

            One way in which the attacker is able to achieve this, is to send you a link to a webpage which fires the request. For this demonstration we created one such evil website. 

            Please go to the evil website, the details on the attack will be explained there.
            <br />
            <br />
            <a href="http://localhost:81">Link to the evil website</a>
            <!-- As explained earlier, the userCSRF exploits backends like these -->
          </p>

        </div>


          <!-- <pre class="prettyprint">
          // The same example with other parameters
          <input class="request-input" type="text" value="http://insecurebanking.com/api/transfer_money?to=3&amount=1337"/>
          </pre>  -->
