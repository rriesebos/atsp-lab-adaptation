      <h3>What?</h3>
      <p>In 2018, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8613948">a study by Guo et al.</a> showed that about 74%
        of the 1000 most popular websites by Alexa ranking are using a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
        These CDNs are a proxy in between the client (such as web browsers) that are geographically close to the user and
        provide various benefits. On such benefit is to reduce latency and network traffic by caching static files.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2017, a vulnerability was discovered by Omer Gil as explained on his
        <a href="https://omergil.blogspot.com/2017/02/web-cache-deception-attack.html">Blog</a> called <i>Web Cache Deception</i>.
        Web Cache Deception allows an attacker to steal highly confidential information of a victim, whenever the CDN
        has cache rules that are too aggressive.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>First, the attacker needs to find a vulnerable website by trying to modify the URL. There are two conditions
        that must hold for this URL, in order to perform an attack:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The intermediate proxy with caching must think the URL is a static file and will cache the response from the web server.</li>
          <li>The URL must be interpreted as a regular URL by the web server, and thus, return personal information on the webpage.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        Let's say the attacker is looking for performing this attack on the following fictional URL: <i>somebank.com/profile</i>.
        The attacker will modify the URL to the following: <i>somebank.com/profile/img.png</i> and notices it shows the initial
        profile webpage. While opening an incognito browser, the user sees the <b>exact</b> same webpage <u>without being logged in!</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the attacker sends a slightly different URL (to bypass cache) to the victim. The victim opens the URL, but
        sees a regular webpage. The user has no reason for suspicion, because there is nothing odd about the webpage
        (besides the slight URL modification).
      </p>
      <p>
        The attacker checks back on the same URL that the attacker sent to the victim, to see if it has been opened, and thus,
        cached yet. If so, the attacker now sees the same HTML-content as the victim when the victim is logged in!
      </p>
      <h3>Consequences</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>
        There are two major consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
          First and most obviously, every information that the web server shows to the user is now in the hands of the attacker.
          It depends on the website and webpage, but examples include username, mail address, home address, telephone number,
          bank details, order history, chat messages, credit card information and anything else you can think of.
      </p><p>
          There is also a second consequence that perhaps occurs less frequently, but could be even more dangerous. In case
          the web server also embeds any sort of tokens in the HTML DOM, these can be stolen by the attacker as well.
          The first example would be when the page includes a form with a token linked to the user, allowing the attacker to submit
          a form on the user's behalf. A second example could be that the webpage embeds cookies / session tokens in the page.
          Then, an attacker can simply steal the session token, and depending on the security checks of the website, the attacker
          could be logged in on the user's account.
